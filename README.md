# Welcome to SFFC Beaver extension

Beaver who is an experience developer (of his dam) will help you with routine in your SFCC projects.

## Features

* Beaver can copy requires, includes, and resource properties to the clipboard using **ðŸ¦« sf extract** command.

* You can also call command **ðŸ¦« unix path** to copy full path of the active file to clipboard. This can be useful not only for SFCC projects.

To activate command press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` and start typing name of the command.

## Road Map

There are plenty of things that Beaver would like to learn:

* How to override files from one cartridge to another. So you can simply override scripts, templates, forms, and properties files. (And it is his current task)

* How to create cartridge from scratch

* Help with managing meta
