> 💡 You can use Command Pallette to do it even quicker.

### Commands

Beaver adds several new commands that you can run manually.

To run a command you need to open the command pallette (press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P`) and enter the command name.

- **▰ Extract** Swiss-kni command copies to clipboard require of the file depends on type.
  - for scripts file copy require: `var fileName = require('*/filePath')`
  - for templates file copy isinclude: `<isinclude template='templatePath' />`
  - for resource properties file copy active line as `Resource.msg('{activeLinePropName}', '{fileName}', null)`
- **▰ Copy unix path** command copies file path relatively to the project root folder.
- **▰ Override** command overrides current file to another cartridge

### Beaver Dam

Beaver introduces a new side section called Beaver Dam. There are two items currently:

- **Cartridges** is a active cartridge list where you can pin/unpin cartridge for overriding.
- **Documentation**. Search in docs without leaving VS Code. Currently not available.
- **Hooks** shows all project hooks
